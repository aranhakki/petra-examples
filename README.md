# Petra Examples

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)

Welcome to the **petra-examples** repository! This project is a curated collection of programming examples written in **Petra**, a language designed to bring scalable formal methods to the masses. 

This repository is designed as a sandbox for developers to learn, experiment, and formally verify Petra programs using a hybrid local/remote workflow.

**Official Documentation:** [www.petracode.co.uk](https://www.petracode.co.uk)

## 🚀 The Petra Workflow

Developing in Petra via this repository follows a unique two-step process:

1.  **Local Syntax Validation:** Use the provided Petra AST library to check your code's syntax on your local machine.
2.  **Remote Formal Verification:** Raise a Pull Request (PR) to trigger the **Petra Verifier Build Server** on GitHub, which performs a full formal verification analysis.

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Before you can validate Petra code locally, you must install the Petra AST dependency into your local Maven repository.

### 1. Prerequisites
* **Java:** JDK 8 or higher.
* **Build Tool:** Apache Maven.

### 2. Local Installation
A pre-built library is included in the `/lib` folder. Run the following command from the project root to install it:

```bash
mvn install:install-file \
   -Dfile=lib/petra-ast-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
   -DgroupId=com.cognitionbox.petra \
   -DartifactId=petra-ast \
   -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT \
   -Dpackaging=jar
```

### 3. Maven Dependency
Once installed, your project will recognize the following dependency, add it in order to perform local petra syntax checking:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.cognitionbox.petra</groupId>
    <artifactId>petra-ast</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

### 4. Petra Syntax Checker
Run the syntax checker by executing the ```PetraVerification``` JUnit tests by right-clicking on the tests and running within the IDE, or by using the following maven command
```mvn clean test```.

## 📝 Rules of Engagement

To keep the build server happy and the verification process secure, please observe these strict constraints:

* **Java Files Only:** You may only commit and push changes to `.java` files. Modifying `pom.xml`, project configurations, or the `lib/` directory will result in an automatic build failure.
* **Testing:** Traditional unit tests can be written and used locally, but they should not be committed to the main branch, as the build server is only for executing Petra's formal verification process.
* **Rate Limits:** Users are currently limited to approximately **3 builds per hour**. Use your local syntax checker to catch early mistakes before pushing to GitHub!
* **Verification:** Formal verification is only triggered upon raising a **Pull Request**.
